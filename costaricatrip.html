     Carlito's Trip to Costa Rica <img src="costa rica flag.jpg" alt="costa rica flag" ></h1>
   
   
   <p style="font-size: 23px;">
    My trip starts by arriving at Costa Rica's busy capital, San Jose. The pictures below our aerial views from the airplane and photos walking around the capital.

  <p style = "font-size: 25px;">However, after an hour, I leave San Jose as I have been to Costa Rica many times and the capital is full of bums and drug addicts.Typical big city vibes. So I always make my way to La Fortuna, the beach, and <strong>Quesada</strong> city which happens to be spelled just like my last name. It's also the city I was born in.</p>
 
 
  <p style = "font-size: 25px;">Below is my home in Costa Rica with me next to a very good friend of mine. I grew up here until I was 8 years old and moved to Las Vegas.</p>

 <p style = "font-size:25px;">This is Rio Celeste, which means Celest River in Spanish. There is a mineral in the water which turns the water into this aqua blue. It is gorgeous and has a very beautiful waterfall.
  This is one of the most famous places in all of Costa Rica </p>

 <p style="font-size:25px;"> One of the best plates to eat while in Costa Rica is a <strong>Casado.</strong>It is one of the most typical plates in Costa Rica and the food is so fresh.</p>

 <p style="font-size:25px;"> In Costa Rica it is extremely prohibited to kill any wildlife. The iguana below is at a reserve where there is a lot of birds, iguanas, sloths as well as crocodiles.</p>
